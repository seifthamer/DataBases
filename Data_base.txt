MongoDB and SQL are two types of databases. MongoDB is a NoSQL database used for handling unstructured data, while SQL is a traditional relational database used for smaller, structured data sets. MongoDB offers horizontal scalability and high availability, with faster read and write operations, making it ideal for real-time applications. SQL offers better support for complex queries and transactions, making it suitable for applications that require data integrity and consistency. Ultimately, the choice between MongoDB and SQL depends on the specific needs of the application.
